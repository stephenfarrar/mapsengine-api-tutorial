##API Key##  
Before you can get started you will need an API key. The Google Maps Engine API requires each user to have a unique API key in order to access data stored in GME projects. To obtain an API key, you will need to follow these steps:  

1. You will need a Google account. If you do not already have one, go [here](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp) and create an account.  
2. Once you have signed up, go to the [Google Developers' Console](https://cloud.google.com/console) and sign in.  
3. Create a project using the 'Create Project' button in the top left corner. You can leave the defaults if you want to.  
4. Click on the project you have created.  
5. Select 'APIs & auth' from the left hand menu. From the drop-down, go to 'APIs'. Scroll down until you find the 'Google Maps Engine API' and change its status from OFF to ON.  
6. Next, go to 'Credentials' on the left menu. Under Public API access, click the 'Create New Key' button to make your API key. Make sure you select 'Browser key' from the options then click 'Create'.  
7. You should now see your API key. Copy and paste it below.
