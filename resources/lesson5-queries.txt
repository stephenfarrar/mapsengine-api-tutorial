##Queries##  
If you want to query a table for specific data, you can add additional parameters to a List Features request including:  

* intersects: get features which intersect with a geometry (point, polygon, circle, linestring)
* limit: create an upper bound of the number of features returned.
* select: specifies which properties of the features will be shown in the result, equivalent to SQL projection clause. It can also be used to create a new property (column alias).
* where: create a condition that must be fulfilled by the features returned. Equivalent to SQL predicate.
* orderBy: specified the ordering of the features returned (ascending/descending). It is equivalent to SQL order and it is ascending by default.  

For example, if you only want to find the first two cities in the 'Famous Cities' table, and only display the 'Name' property, you could request: `https://www.googleapis.com/mapsengine/v1/tables/15474835347274181123-14495543923251622067/features?version=published&key=AIzaSyA72mMb9IsfSDWA_7RVpCo3_LM_7P2hlXY&select=Name&limit=2`

For more information regarding queries and a full list of available parameters, you can read the [GME API Documentation for list features]//developers.google.com/maps-engine/documentation/read).

**EXERCISE**  
Try to query the 'Famous Cities' table to list cities whose “Population” is less than 2 million. Use the table ID = 15474835347274181123-14495543923251622067 and your valid API Key for the URL, then click submit.
