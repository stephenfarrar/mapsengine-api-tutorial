##GME API##  
Google Maps Engine hosts location-based data and allows you to access it in a number of ways, including a web API for reading and writing. The GME web API allows users to manage data using simple HTTP requests.

Reading data requires a GET request which returns a standard HTTP response as well as other information about the map data. This is achieved using structured URLs that use paths and parameters, just the same as you would enter into your browser.
