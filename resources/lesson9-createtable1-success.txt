Congratulations! You have just created an empty table in your project. You can check it in [this link](//mapsengine.google.com/admin/#RepositoryPlace:cid={PROJECT_ID}&v=DETAIL_INFO&aid={ASSET_ID}), and go to the 'Data Sources' menu. The name of the table is `World Famous Mountains`. The table can only be edited by `Map Editors`, and since we do not specify who can view it, only `Map Editors` can view the table by default (making it a private table). The table schema contains `geometry`, `mountain_name`, and `height`.  
Currently, the table does not contain any features yet, but later on, you will add a feature to this table. Each feature in the table will represent a mountain, which includes the point (longitude and latitude), the name, and the height of the mountain. The server also send you back a response. We will explain this response in the next lesson, but please take a look at it.
